# Welcome to White Devils Tech Community
White Devils is an independent, student-led tech community built on collaboration, curiosity, and career growth. It’s a space where students, developers, tech enthusiasts, and innovators across India come together to learn, share, and build — beyond textbooks and classroom boundaries.

Founded by passionate students, the community exists to bridge the gap between education and real-world tech exposure, through:

Hackathons & Ideathons – Fueling problem-solving and creative thinking

Skill-building events – From coding to worshops to bootcamps

Knowledge sharing – Courses, internships, scholarships, and tech events curated 

Campus Ambassador Program – Empowering college reps to lead locally and connect nationally

Collaborative Networking – Creating meaningful connections between peers and professionals

We don’t just post events.
We build a platform where young minds can level up, teach each other, and grow together — no gatekeeping, no noise, no corporate blah-blah.

## Vision:
To be India’s most authentic and impactful student-powered tech collective — by students, for students.

## In simple words:
"White Devils is your tech circle that actually shares useful stuff — not just scams or fake job links."

Whether you're a curious beginner or a hackathon hustler — if you're hungry to learn and grow in tech, there's a place for you here.
